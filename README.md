# MyPolybench
A repository for storing optimization codes of polybench written by L. N. Pouchet, see http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~pouchet/.

# Notice
Currently only the polybench*/stencil/jacobi-2d codes are optimized. The performance of different optimization versions are shown in the file "ComparionExecutionTime.ods".
